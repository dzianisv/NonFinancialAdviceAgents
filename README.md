# Financial Advisor Agent — Agentic Hedge-Fund + Crypto Workflows

> ⚠️ **Educational analysis only — not financial advice.** Past backtest performance does not guarantee future results. Validate with a fee-only fiduciary before deploying real capital.

A portable skill+workflow layer that turns **Claude Code, openclaw, or hermes** into a proactive financial advisor — watching markets daily and surfacing time-sensitive setups before they're missed.

The agent proposes; the human approves every order. Recommend-only, always.

## Two active workstreams

### 1. Stocks / TradFi portfolio workflow

Manages a **~$1M tradfi book** (RSP 70 / GLD 15 / IEF 15 baseline) through an AI-bubble environment. Runs the loop: **regime-detect → scan → committee → human-approve → execute → report**.

Key artifacts:

| Artifact | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`GOAL.md`](GOAL.md) | Mission + bubble evidence + done/not-done checklist |
| [`strategy/v3`](strategy/v3-bubble-aware-all-weather.md) | Bubble-Aware All-Weather strategy (the recommended allocation) |
| [`docs/prd.md`](docs/prd.md) | Features, cadence, personas |
| [`docs/tdd.md`](docs/tdd.md) | Architecture, wiring diagrams, data contracts |
| [`.agents/workflows/hedge-fund-committee.workflow.js`](.agents/workflows/) | Weekly committee → ranked next-buy memo |

Core skills: `regime-detection` · `trend-stock-research` · `dip-screener` · `fomc-monitor` · `prediction-market-odds` · `forecast-ledger` · `hedge-fund-manager` · `superforecasting` · `macro-panel` · `multi-lens-quorum`

**Status:** fast-tier daily scanners live on openclaw (cron + liveness); weekly committee workflow validated (3 iterations); congress stock-watch wired (`congress/`).

---

### 2. Crypto portfolio workflow

Manages a **~$177k crypto book** with a BTC-as-hurdle filter — only deploy into tokens that pass the 6-point infrastructure value-accrual test (HYPE the current benchmark).

Full spec: [`crypto/`](crypto/) — `crypto.goal.md` · `crypto.prd.md` · `crypto.tdd.md` · `crypto.loop.md`

Core skills: `crypto-chair` · `crypto-research-desk` · `crypto-dip-scanner` · `crypto-liquidity-data` · `crypto-onchain-data` · `crypto-workflow-eval` · `analyst-crypto`

**Status:** skill tree designed + specced; G-Eval harness baselined (85/100); crypto.loop.md orchestrates daily dip-scan + weekly research desk cycle.

## Deployment targets

Same skills install onto any of:

| Runtime | Scheduling primitive | Notification |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | `/loop` + Routines + dynamic workflows | terminal / push |
| **openclaw** | `heartbeat` + `HEARTBEAT.md` | Telegram DM |
| **hermes-ai** | hermes scheduler | configured channel |

## Backtest summary (tradfi v3)

1. **Don't bet the whole $1M on cap-weight S&P/QQQ at CAPE ~41.** 2000-2026 backtest: S&P −55%, QQQ −83%; 2000-2009 was a lost decade.
2. **Selection isn't the edge.** Bottom-up stock-picking doesn't reliably beat a cheap index (backtests + SPIVA).
3. **The edge is structural.** De-concentrated diversification + trend/regime overlay (crisis alpha) + dip-reserve = caps left tail without a market call. → [`strategy/v3`](strategy/v3-bubble-aware-all-weather.md)
